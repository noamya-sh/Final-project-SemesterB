## General overview of the repository:

1. **Improvement of the classification notebook from semester A.**<br>
    *cardio-disease-classification*:broken_heart:<br>
  Running additional models we learned in the second semester (such as ensemble models) in an attempt to improve accuracy. With all the effort, KNN still performs the best           classification in this case.
2. **Fashion-Mnist** :mans_shoe::dress::tshirt::jeans::sandal:<br>
  Fashion pictures classification to 10 different labels, using the models and methods we learned in the semester B (*without SVM and CNN*).<br>
3. **Dogs Vs Cats**  :dog::cat:<br>
*This is easy for humans, but Computer will find it a bit more difficult...*<br>
pictures classification to dog and cat labels, using the models and methods we learned in the semester B (*without SVM and CNN*).
4. **Hand-States** :thumbsup::thumbsdown:<br>
Classification of hand positions to 3 labels: Alone mode, Spontaneous mode and Sync mode. Includes a lot of work with Pandas.
